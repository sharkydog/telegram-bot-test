# telegram-bot-test
Playground for php-telegram-bot

## Install
- composer it
- create a database and import vendor/longman/telegram-bot/structure.sql
- copy/rename config.sample.php as config.php and edit
- setup the webhook by running https://yourdomain.tld/path/to/hook.php?set

## Use
This is a (very) basic bot, its purpose is to test/develop some commands and for me to publish stuff that have no place in official code, not even in a fork.

So, use however you like.

## Credits
No credits, no money, just few beers left in the fridge and some icy rakija (I think grapes, but not sure).
